# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The game allows a user to play against a computer opponent, where the user can choose either "Shinju" (stone), "Kami" (paper), or "Hasami" (scissors), and the computer randomly selects its move. The winner is determined based on the traditional rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Run the game:

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your move (0 for Shinju, 1 for Kami, 2 for Hasami). The computer's move will also be displayed.

5. The game will announce the winner based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

## Code Structure

[rock_paper_scissors.py](https://github.com/Omkarpote28/Chronicles-Oceanic-Clash/blob/main/rock_paper_Scissors.py)`: This is the main Python script that contains the game logic. It generates a random move for the computer, takes user input, and determines the winner.

## Rules

- Shinju (stone) crushes Hasami (scissors).
- Kami (paper) covers Shinju (stone).
- Hasami (scissors) cuts Kami (paper).

## Acknowledgements
